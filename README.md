## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Preprocessor [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Javascript

### Useful resources

- [Making a toggle switch](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - Learned how to create a toggle switch using the css.
- [Using box-shadow](https://flaviocopes.com/css-border-inside-element/) - In the original design you need to put a border in the button when it's activated, however using the property border create more space in the element, so using a box-shadow is a great tip because it doesn't use space.
- [Ternary operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) - Really cool to use ternary operator in javascript, since you can use less line of code and do if/else more efficient.
